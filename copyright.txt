An exception is the collection of individual *.wrl files which contain the
mathematical description of each polyhedron. Because these contain mathematical
information, they may be of use to others with an interest in polyhedra. They
may be reproduced and used for noncommercial purposes. Note that a written
comment to this effect is already present in each of the data files.
